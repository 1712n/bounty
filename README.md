# Welcome to the Inca Bounty Program!

## Background

[Inca](https://www.incas.ec/) often uses "bounty projects" as introductory projects to vet potential employees or interns. These projects give interested individuals a chance to prove themselves, learn a bit about our company & products, and produce a useful result in the process. These projects are extremely independent and will require you to manage your own time and work process. All tasks in our Bounty Program are paid and we are constantly adding new ones. If you want more work in a specific area, send us a message and we'll do our best to create more tasks.

[NTerminal](https://www.nterminal.com) is a data aggregation and analytics platform used for navigating the crypto-financial ecosystem. NTerminal's many data streams can be categorized into three general segments:
1. **Financial data** - Trade and order book data from exchanges and aggregation entities (price, size, trade-pair, volumes, etc.)
2. **Natural Language data** - Text-based data streams with keyword & sentiment analysis (social media posts, news articles, regulatory meeting minutes, etc.)
3. **Technical data** from Blockchains, mining pools, code fuzzing, github repositories, etc.

## General rules
* Anyone can participate in getting a bounty. You do not need our approval to start working or to submit your results.
* We will pay the bounty and close the issue as soon as we get a good quality submission that fulfills all of the requirements listed in the issue description.
* By completing this project you agree to let Inca use any and all work submitted for any internal or external purposes. Inca reserves the right to use or not use any work submitted via this project.

## Navigating and Working with the Tasks

* In the issue list, you'll find a [list tasks that are currently available](https://gitlab.com/IncaOutsourcing/bounty/issues).
* You are free to start working on any available bounty issue whenever you want. You don't need our approval for it. Please comment on this issue to let everyone know if you are working on it.
* For highly complex tasks, we are willing to lock them for qualified candidates to make sure no one else is working on it. For that, please comment below and send your GitLab account along with your resume to bounty@incasec.com. After your resume review, we'll remove the bounty::available tag and assign the issue exclusively to you.

## Pay-out

* It's important to note that many potential hires will compete for the same bounty projects and completing one does not guarantee a payment or a full-time position.
* When you are ready to submit your work, leave a comment in this issue and we'll get in touch with you regarding the payment or to help you make necessary changes to your submission.
* We will pay the bounty and close the issue as soon as we get a good quality submission that fulfills all of the requirements listed here.
* Upon request, we can also create an escrow job on one of the freelancer websites (Upwork, fl.ru, etc). All of this is optional - you can skip this step if you just want to show us the result.

Let us know if you have any questions and looking forward to seeing your work!
