 Click "Apply" next to any job listed above to begin the process. We use a 3-step hiring process:

1) A brief (30 minute max), non-technical, introductory phone call with either the CEO, CTO, or appropriate lead.

2) All technical hires are required to complete compensated code contribution on the repository they'd be working on. 
Non-technical hires will also be asked to complete a compensated trial task after they apply and complete step 1.

Issues in this project are suitable for this purpose.
The issue you choose does not necessarily need to be fully completed, and we don't expect a perfect first contribution.
Open a pull request as soon as you'd like any feedback from one of our developers. 
We compensate at or above market rates for all accepted pull requests.

For questions or problems with a particular issue, 
please comment directly on the GitHub issue. 
For setup or environment trouble, open a separate issue or email the contact listed in the project README. 
You can also join #dev in our chat to interact with other community members.

3) A longer meeting with the team members you'd be working directly with, as well as the CEO and/or CTO.
